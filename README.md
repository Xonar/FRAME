#FRAME

## 3D Rendering Framework

This a a side project I started that aims to be a simple (but good looking) rendering engine.

##README

Features (Planned):

 * Deffered Rendering
 * Pseudo Transparency support
 * Particle System (Still have to put a lot of thought into this as to how I'm going to implement it.
 * Tesselation (Not sure if I'm going to include this as it is going to be a major performance problem)

Effects (Planned):

 * Ambient Occlutions
 * Soft Shadows
 * Motion Blur
 * Dynamic Lights (And lots of them)
 
###Notes

 * I ussually don't have too much time to spend on projects like these, but we'll see how things go.
 * I'm putting it up on github since it makes it easy for me moving between computers. Your welcome to look at, quote and use anything here as long as you reference this when doing so. (When using this in a non-open source project of your own please ask for permission. I won't go hunting you down if you don't - Not sure how I'll know anyway - , but please do).
 * You need to run it from the root directory to detect shader/assets

###Bugs

 * Yes, the font class doesn't do half the stuff it's supposed to yet.
 * When cloning it directly you'll be missing the Assets folder. (This is on purpose)
 * The Game.cpp is for setting up the scene. Currently it's just a simple scene that requires some of my Assests.
 * Missing a large part of the framework (It's still in development - pre-pre-alpha if you will)

###Assets

You can download the needed assets here : http://www.mediafire.com/download/lhk04fkc0fls7h7/Assets.zip

Here is where the assets come from
http://openfontlibrary.org/en/font/cosmic-sans-neue-mono

http://tf3dm.com/3d-model/beach-16949.html (I modified it by scaling it and adding a light and camera)
